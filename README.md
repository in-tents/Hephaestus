# Hephaestus

The idea is a smart calculator that can completely remove the need for anyone to learn how to write code, allowing a fuller focus on building beautiful programs.

3 outputs:
Solution: structured output of the solution, "return"ing the answer directly into the codebase (hopefully anyway).
Chain of Thought: Just so you can monitor the thought process and debug if anything comes out funny looking.
Block: if you are going to be running into a problem a lot, Hephaestus can design algorithms and codeblocks for long term use.

"How do you know it works?"
Well, I do not know how to code very well, I am like 80% through robospital, so the fact this functions is proof it works.
